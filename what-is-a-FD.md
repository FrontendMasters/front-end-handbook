# What is a front-end developer?

A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies (i.e. HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript) which run on the web platform or act as compilation input for non-web platform environments.

Typically, a developer enters into the field of front-end development by developing for some type of [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser), native webview, or [headless browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser) running on a device (desktops, laptops, netbooks, tablets, phones) enabled with web platform capabilities.

Web browsers typically run on a computer, tablet, or phone but as of late a browser can be found on just about any device (i.e IoT). 

The most common web browsers are: 

* [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Internet Explorer](http://dev.modern.ie/)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) 
* [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/)

Native webviews are used by operating systems to run web pages. Think of a webivew like an iframe or a single tab from a web browser that is embedded in a native application running on iOS, android, windows, or OSX.

The most common solutions for webview development are:

* [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js)
* [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
* [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)

Headless browsers are a web browser without a graphical user interface that can be controlled from a command line interface for the purpose of web page automation (e.g. functional testing, scraping, unit testing etc..).

The most common headless browsers are:

* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)
* [trifleJS](http://triflejs.org/)

Eventually, what is learned from web browser development can be used by front-end developers to craft code for environments that are not fueled by a browser engine. As of late, development environments are being dreamed up that use web technologies, without web engines, to create truly native applications.

Some examples of these environments are: 

* [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
