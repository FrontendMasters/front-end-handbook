## Learn HTTP/Networks (Including CORS & WebSockets)

> **HTTP** - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

> **CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g., fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.

>**WebSockets** - WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.
