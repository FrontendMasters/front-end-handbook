# Self directed learning

This section focuses on free and paid resources (video training, books etc..) that an individual can use to direct their own learning process and career as a front-end developer.

The resources include free material and paid material. Paid material will be indicated with [$].

The author believes that anyone with the right determination and dedication can teach themselves how to be a front-end developer. All that is required is a computer connected to the web and some cash for books and video training.
